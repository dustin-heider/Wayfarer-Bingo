# Wayfarer D/A/CH-Bingo
Simple Bingo with categories to find during review challenges. German language.

How does it work:

Categories are already included in easy_categories and hard_categories. Just press play on main.py and you will be asked on the command line
to give a name (_blank_ will turn into "Standard-Bingo"). Then add a number between 0 - 16. This will be the number of hard categories.

The program will now process your inputs and create a Tkinter Canvas with your inputs, the current day as a date and random categories.
This is how the template looks like before you run the program:

After you input the name and number of hard categories:
